Content is written in markdown and everything is edited in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [neovim](https://neovim.io/). Images are edited in 
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and optimised using [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim) or [OptiPNG](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/).

The site runs off of [Pico CMS](https://picocms.org/). Version control and updating is done through git. An up-to-date clone of this site's code is maintained at 
[GitHub](https://github.com/beyondmeh/beyondmeh.com).

The site is served by [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) running on [Debian](https://debian.org). The box is hosted by [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) in Newark, NJ 
and uses domain services from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

This site has never implemented any form of advertising. If you see such, you may be infected with malware. For the curious, the total infrastructure
cost (hosting, domain name, bandwidth, etc) is exactly $75.50 per year.
