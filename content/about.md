# About Me
My name is Timothy Keith and I live in Chesapeake Beach, Maryland located in the United States. I'm with-in walking distance to the Chesapeake Bay and tend to take a lot of my photos near the water.

I'm relatively new to photography, starting late in 2023. My camera is a Canon EOS Rebel T100 also known as a 4000D outside of the United States. My favorite lens so far is a 55-250mm f/4–5.6. I edit in Adobe Lightroom.

Besides photography, I like computer programming and tinkering and making devices with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). I've used Linux since 2005 (my first distro was [Mandrake Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandriva_Linux) before it became Mandrivia) and have since moved on to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) for desktop and [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org) for servers.

My daily drivers are a M1 MacBook Air and a M2 Mac Mini. I work a lot from the command line and use the fish shell and neovim. My [dotfiles](https://github.com/beyondmeh/dotfiles) are on GitHub and are designed to work on macOS, Linux, and BSD. 

When I'm not nerding out with computers, I enjoy retro gaming (NES and Gameboy Advance). I'm also a heavy reader, my favorite genre is Science Fiction and Fantasy. My top five authors (in alphabetical order) are Brandon Sanderson, Naomi Novik, Neal Stephenson, Neil Gaiman, and Piers Anthony.

I am very liberal with anyone who wants to use my work. Any code I've written is placed under an [ISC license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license) and photos are under the [Creative Commons BY license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#Four_rights). Both essentially allow you to do whatever you want with my work, so long as you give me credit.
