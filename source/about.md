# About Me
My name is Timothy Keith and I live in Chesapeake Beach, Maryland located in the United States. I'm with-in walking distance to the Chesapeake Bay and tend to take a lot of my photos near the water.

I'm relatively new to photography, starting late in 2023. My camera is a [Canon EOS Rebel T100](https://www.canon.ca/en/product?name=EOS_Rebel_T100) also known as the 4000D outside of the United States. My favorite lens so far is a 55-250mm f/4–5.6. I edit in [ON1 Photo RAW](https://www.on1.com/products/photo-raw/) and [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/).

Besides photography, I like computer programming (Python is my favorite language) and tinkering with electronics with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). I've used Linux since 2005 (my first distro was [Mandrake Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandriva_Linux) before it became Mandriva) and have since moved on to [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org) for desktop and [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org) for servers.

My daily drivers are a M1 MacBook Air and a M2 Mac Mini. I work a lot from the command line and use the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com) with [starship](https://starship.rs) prompt and [Helix](https://helix-editor.com) for editing. My [dotfiles](https://github.com/beyondmeh/dotfiles) are on GitHub and are designed to work on macOS, Linux, and BSD. 

When I'm not nerding out with computers, I enjoy retro gaming (NES and Gameboy) on my [Anbernic RG35XX Plus](https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-plus). I'm also a heavy reader, my favorite genre is Science Fiction and Fantasy. My top five authors (in alphabetical order) are Douglas Adams, Piers Anthony, Naomi Novik, Brandon Sanderson, and Neal Stephenson.

I am very liberal with anyone who wants to use my work. Any code I've written is placed under an [ISC license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license) and photos are under the [Creative Commons BY license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#Four_rights). Both essentially allow you to do whatever you want with my work, so long as you give me credit.
