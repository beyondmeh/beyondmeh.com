# What I’m Doing Right Now
*(this is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. If you have your own site, you should [make one](https://nownownow.com/about) too!)*

## Where and When
Updated August 21, 2024, from my home in Chesapeake Beach, Maryland. It’s Summer and currently sunny outside.

## Family Life
My wife is already back at school, but the students don’t start until next week. Speaking of, this will be the first year both girls will be in school: Kindergarten and Second Grade. 

## Employment
I’ve been promoted from Election Technician to Election Systems Automation Coordinator. I’m very pleased to have gotten 2 steps for a pay raise with the new role.

## Personal Enrichment
I’m currently studying to get my CompTIA A+ certification. I’m already knowledgeable on the subject matter from my Master’s degree, but I want to catch up to my peers that already have the certification. 

## Tech Projects 
* Conversion of this site from a blog into a photography portfolio.
* Setting up [Fedora server](https://fedoraproject.org/en/server/) in my home lab.
* Helping my spouse with her new programming class for middle schoolers.
